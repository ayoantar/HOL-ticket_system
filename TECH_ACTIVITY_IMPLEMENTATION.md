# Tech Activity Logging Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive tech activity logging system that separates original ticket content (read-only) from tech activities (logged separately), ensuring data integrity while providing complete tracking capabilities.

## Key Features

### 1. **Separate Activity Logging**
- Original ticket content becomes read-only after submission
- All tech activities are logged in separate `tech_activities` table
- Maintains complete audit trail without modifying original data

### 2. **Role-Based Permissions**
- **Client**: Can view ticket details and public activities
- **Employee (Tech)**: Can update status and log activities for assigned tickets
- **Lead**: Can update status and log activities for department tickets
- **Admin**: Full access to all features

### 3. **Activity Types**
- `status_change`: Status updates with old/new status tracking
- `internal_note`: Internal notes visible only to techs
- `work_started`: Work commencement logging
- `work_completed`: Work completion logging
- `info_requested`: Information requests from client
- `escalated`: Ticket escalation (internal only)

## Database Schema

### TechActivity Model
```javascript
{
  id: INTEGER (Primary Key),
  ticketId: INTEGER (Foreign Key → tickets.id),
  techId: INTEGER (Foreign Key → users.id),
  activityType: ENUM('status_change', 'internal_note', 'work_started', 'work_completed', 'info_requested', 'escalated'),
  oldStatus: VARCHAR(20), // For status_change activities
  newStatus: VARCHAR(20), // For status_change activities
  notes: TEXT,
  isInternal: BOOLEAN (Default: false),
  timeSpent: INTEGER, // Minutes
  createdAt: TIMESTAMP (Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Tech Routes (`/api/tech/`)
All routes require authentication and employee/lead role.

1. **`PUT /tickets/:ticketId/status`**
   - Update ticket status
   - Body: `{ status, notes?, timeSpent? }`
   - Creates activity log and status history

2. **`POST /tickets/:ticketId/internal-note`**
   - Add internal note (tech only)
   - Body: `{ notes, timeSpent? }`
   - Creates internal activity log

3. **`POST /tickets/:ticketId/activity`**
   - Log work activity
   - Body: `{ activityType, notes?, timeSpent? }`
   - Creates activity log with appropriate visibility

4. **`GET /tickets/:ticketId/activities`**
   - Get ticket activities
   - Query: `?includeInternal=true/false`
   - Returns filtered activities based on permissions

5. **`GET /my-tickets`**
   - Get assigned tickets with activity summary
   - Query: `?status=<status>&page=1&limit=10`

## Frontend Components

### 1. **TechStatusUpdate Component**
- Status update interface for techs
- Internal note section
- Quick action buttons (Start Work, Complete Work, etc.)
- Time tracking functionality
- Role-based field restrictions

### 2. **TechActivityLog Component**
- Activity timeline display
- Internal/external activity filtering
- Activity type icons and color coding
- Tech attribution and timestamps
- List-based UI (no external dependencies)

### 3. **Enhanced TicketDetail Component**
- Tech status update section for assigned techs
- Activity log display for all users
- Original ticket content protection
- Role-based interface switching

## User Workflow

### For Technicians (Employee Role):
1. Receive ticket assignment
2. Access ticket detail page
3. Use TechStatusUpdate component to:
   - Update ticket status
   - Add internal notes
   - Log work activities
   - Track time spent
4. All activities logged separately from original ticket

### For Leads:
1. Access department tickets
2. Same tech interface as employees
3. Can update any ticket in their department
4. Can view internal activities

### For Clients:
1. View original ticket content (read-only)
2. See public activity updates
3. Receive notifications for status changes
4. Cannot modify original submission

### For Admins:
1. Full access to all features
2. Can edit original ticket content
3. Can view all activities including internal
4. Complete system oversight

## Security & Permissions

### Access Control:
- Department-based restrictions for leads
- Assignment-based restrictions for employees
- Original ticket content protection
- Internal activity visibility controls

### Data Integrity:
- Separate activity logging preserves original data
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- Role-based API endpoint restrictions
- Audit trail for all changes

## Technical Implementation

### Backend:
- Express.js with Sequelize ORM
- PostgreSQL database with proper indexes
- JWT authentication with role-based middleware
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Frontend:
- React with Material-UI components
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Role-based conditional rendering
- Real-time updates and notifications

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Original ticket content remains unchanged
2. **Complete Audit Trail**: All tech activities are logged with timestamps
3. **Role-Based Access**: Appropriate permissions for each user type
4. **Time Tracking**: Built-in time spent tracking for activities
5. **Professional Interface**: Clean, intuitive UI for tech operations
6. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to extend with additional activity types

## Installation & Setup

1. Backend database migration:
   ```bash
   psql -U username -d database_name -f backend/database/migrations/add_tech_activities.sql
   ```

2. Frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```

3. Server restart to load new models and routes

## Future Enhancements

- File attachment support for activities
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Mobile-responsive improvements
- Integration with external ticketing systems
- Advanced time tracking features
